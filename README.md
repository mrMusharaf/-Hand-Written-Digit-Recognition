### Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
#### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Brief Introduction**: 
     This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, which is a benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset includes grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels.

   - **Purpose of Handwritten Digit Recognition**: 
     Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision and pattern recognition, with applications ranging from automated data entry systems to postal mail sorting. The goal is to accurately classify and recognize digits written by different individuals.

   - **Overview of the Models and Techniques Used**: 
     The project implements multiple machine learning models to perform handwritten digit recognition. The models and techniques used include:
     - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A deep learning model designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A classical machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, which finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes.
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
     - **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
     - **Data Preprocessing Techniques**: Including normalization, noise reduction, and data augmentation to improve model performance.
     - **Feature Extraction**: Using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for enhancing the feature representation and reducing dimensionality.
