## Hand Written Digit Recognition

### 1. **Introduction**
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using various machine learning models, including CNN, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest. The primary goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and to enable real-time predictions on new images.

### 2. **Installation**
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. A `requirements.txt` file will be provided to install all required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Dataset**
- **MNIST Dataset**: This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

### 4. **Usage**
- **Running the Project**: 
  1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
  2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.

- **Training Models**: 
  - Execute the provided code to train models like CNN, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest on the MNIST dataset. The models will be trained and evaluated on the dataset, with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score reported.

- **Real-time Predictions**:
  - Use the provided functions to load, preprocess, and predict handwritten digits from new images. Simply provide the path to a new image, and the model will output the predicted digit.

### 5. **Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
- Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
- Create a pull request describing your changes.
